Effective Programming

This paper aims to improve and develop your programming skills by setting a series of exercises, called études, which require an analytical and creative approach to problem solving. Most, but not all, of them will involve programming tasks. Some will not use computers at all, while others will use computers only for ancillary tasks. Each solution will be assessed against the requirements and you will be expected to go back and rework each étude until it is completed satisfactorily. You will be required to fully test and debug your programs as well as learn to identify inefficiencies.

The main objectives of this course are to develop and foster general skills relating to computer related techniques, understanding a problem, problem solving strategies and working with people. Most of the études will require working in pairs or in groups, although some exercises are individual work. There are no lectures, but weekly town hall meetings will be used to discuss or propose solutions, give hints, and reflect on the things you've learned.
